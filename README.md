# end-me-again

Once again this took too long to do.

## Credits to Contributors:

### Idiot 1, **Aditya**: 

Base Code and completely revamped base code, going from 260 to 55 lines.

### Idiot 2, **Vivyan**:

 Spent 4 hours coding ~260 lines just for it to get deleted and fixed Aditya's small brain moments with the dictionary and added file reading and printing into console. Also added the Ihit Cameo, made the print statements a tiny bit cleaner, added some extra exceptions to some programs and added the Class Average Calculation by staying up until **12:45 AM** because no one else wanted to and forgot about it

### Idiot 3, **Rathiin**:

Fixed the entire code reduced it from 260 lines to 72 lines, totally revamped the file management part made a function to fetch the report card text files, ***DID EVERYTHING AT THE END*** ~~and ended the project with a huge ego~~

### Idiot 4, **Ihit**:

Made a small cameo and researched how to fix some errors we were coming across *cough cough* going on stack overflow *cough cough*
