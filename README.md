# end-me-again

Once again this took too long to do.

## Credits to Contributors:

### Idiot 1, **Aditya**: 

Base Code and completely revamped base code, going from 260 to 55 lines. Remade the code AGAIN according to Seema ma'am's requirements.

### Idiot 2, **Vivyan**:

 Spent 4 hours coding ~260 lines just for it to get deleted and fixed Aditya's small brain moments with the dictionary and added file reading and printing into console. Made the print statements a tiny bit cleaner, added some extra exceptions to some programs and added the Class Average Calculation by staying up until **12:45 AM** because no one else wanted to and forgot about it. Worked on the new code made by Aditya, fixed the cardEditor() function, made the classCard() function and created a workflow system with steps(at the bottom) that were to be followed.

### Idiot 3, **Rathiin**:

Fixed the entire code reduced it from 260 lines to 72 lines, totally revamped the file management part made a function to fetch the report card text files, ***DID EVERYTHING AT THE END*** ~~and ended the project with a huge ego~~

### Idiot 4, **Ihit**:

Researched how to fix some errors we were coming across *cough cough* going on stack overflow *cough cough*


### The workflow: (As of the creation of it)


For the Computer Science Report Card Project:

1️⃣ ~~Add a password system for differentiating between teachers and students and make the functions available accordingly.~~

2️⃣ ***Create a prototype for the code with no error handling, assuming the best case scenario***

        ➡️**Show ma'am the prototype with the best case scenario**
        
3️⃣**Send the prototype for testing (we'll all test it and give it to bhaavik too)*

        ➡️*Fix the errors found*
        
4️⃣**Try to perfect the program and make it user friendly**

        ➡️*Give it to classmates for beta testing*
        
        ➡️**Fix the errors that they find**
        
        ➡️***Show ma'am the final version***


Key:

        Almost no importance
        
       *Lowest priority*
       
        **Pretty important**
        
        ***Most important***
        
        1️⃣,2️⃣,3️⃣,4️⃣  Order of tasks
        
        ➡️  Subsections in the tasks.
        
        ~~Finished~~


**Currently Working on:**
